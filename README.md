# WEATHER APP

Created a React Project using React+Vite. APIs used are OpenWeather and GeoDBCities.

Users can enter a city name (with autocomplete) and fetch the weather details for that particular city or location with 7 day forecast.

# Future Scope

+ Improve UI
+ Add Location-based data on load.
